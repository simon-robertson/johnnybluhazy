                        Johnny Bluhazy was born in 1992, in England. Due to a turbulent childhood, he has lived in many counties
                        south of the country and has spent much time travelling in foreign lands as well. Living somewhat of an
                        unconventional life, experiencing many different things, Johnny has found his passion in creative writing
                        and wishes to go on expressing himself in this way.

                            Bluhazy captures, at times poetically, an uneasy life that begins from childhood; where a young boy is
                            witnessing some unpleasant scenarios at home and facing changes, alongside his sister. As we all know,
                            life continues on, time passes, and things start to look up. The boy spends quality time with his mother
                            who he adores and, although things aren't perfect, the family manages.

                            Reaching adolescence, you can see him navigate through life, but then he faces a traumatic turn and, on
                            from then, you see how he attempts to understand life and the ways in which he can take part in it. Adulthood
                            sees him continue to search for love in a world where he sees many problems. Strength and perseverance aren't
                            something in life that stops after you finish a chapter.

                            This story has obstacles in the form of heartbreak, unfavourable family relations and situations, travel
                            induced serenity between hard bouts of being alive and shows there is both cruelness and kindness in life.
